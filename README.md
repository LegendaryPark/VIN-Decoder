# Koffie financial Coding Challenge

## Installation

You need to create your own virtual environment(e.g venv) from your IDE or any code editor.
For VS code, please **[click here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)** to learn how to create/activate venv

Once you have successfully activated your venv, you need to run

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

It will install all required libraries to run/test the app.
